    "# Introducing Solara\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing all this work, we should also review another approach to the entire problem of developing web apps with Python. This approach is called Solara, and it is a Python library that allows you to create web applications using Python code only. This is a very interesting approach, as it allows you to create web applications without having to write any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code. In this notebook, we will introduce Solara and show you how to create a simple web application using it.\n",
