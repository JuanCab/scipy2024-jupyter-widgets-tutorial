    "# Introducing Pydantic: Pythonic Data Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of this notebook \n",
    "This notebook will introduce you to [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), a data validation library that provides a way to define data schemas in a way that is both Pythonic and easy to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *We are using pydantic 2 in this tutorial! Many of the example will not work with pydantic 1.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps you will take in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Review creating a class in Python.\n",
    "2. Learn about data classes in Python.\n",
    "3. Learn how to write a class in Pydantic that enforces data types and constraints\n",
    "4. Very briefly introduce `ipyautoui` to uncover an issue with our model of the controls."

    "## What problem are we trying to solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashboard we have built so far works, but would be hard to include as part of a larger project, and its individual components would be difficult to reuse. For example, the controls to select a range of years and apply smoothing to the data would be useful in making other graphs. As the code stand now, it would be hard to take those pieces as a unit and integrate them into a different dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put differently, one might want a `DataSelector` widget that has as its value a range of years, a smoothing windows, and a polynomial order for the smoothing that can be reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our route to the solution is indirect\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will define a class using Pydantic that does not, by itself, have any widgets attached to it. In the next notebook we will use `ipyautoui` to generate a widget-based user interface from our Pydantic class that will be much easier to reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals for our pydantic class:\n",
    "\n",
    "The class should have these attributes (also called *fields* in the pydantic documentation):\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `year_range`, the range of time selected.\n",
    "+ `window_size`, the size of the smoothing window.\n",
    "+ `polynomial_order`, the order of the polynomial used in smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These attributes also have some important constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The `window_size` should be an integer larger than one and, to match our earlier example, less than or equal to 100.\n",
    "+ The `polynomial_order` should be an integer less than or equal to 10, and less than the `window_size`.\n"
