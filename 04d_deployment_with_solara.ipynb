    "[PyCafe](https://py.cafe) is a web service that utilizes Pyodide to serve up a web app that runs entirely in your browser. There is no Python kernel running in the background, so it scales well. The service is still in beta so you should expect glitches. It is frequently necessary to use the \"System Restart\" menu option to get `scipy` to launch properly, for example. One other thing to be aware of: PyCafe is running in your broswer, so unless you frequently use the \"Push Changes to Cloud\" menu item any changes you have made are lost if your browser page reloads or if you do a \"System Restart\".\n",
