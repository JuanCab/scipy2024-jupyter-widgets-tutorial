    "- [ ] Get to the point where a first version of the dashboard package is created, but note the complexity in the handling of all the settings since we require observer functions to handle all the individual settings (since they are separate widgets).  Do we mention the need to code up validation of the settings (e.g. - We need to ensure the degree of the fit was reasonable give the number of data points, etc.)?\n",

    "\n",
    "- [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai) - a notebook-driven development platform. Simply write notebooks with lightweight markup and get high-quality documentation, tests, continuous integration, and packaging. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [\"modular\" nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/modular_nbdev.html) - makes use of only the most basic features of nbdev. It will allow us take any standalone notebook and turn it into a Python script or module. Modular nbdev will allow us to bridge the gap between messy, exploratory tutorial notebooks and clean, well-organized Python modules that we can import from. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following introduction to \"modular nbdev\" is a much simpler than the [nbdev tutorial](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html), because we won't create a continuous integration Python package that can be uploaded to PyPi or Anaconda. We will simply use notebooks to create clean python modules that we can use to build our dashboards and web apps. From here on out, when we mention nbdev, we are really referring to modular nbdev. "

Instead of cleaning up our notebooks when we have achieved your coding goal, we can leave in all the valuable information we left behind along the way. This is helpful for another developer or our future-selves who may be trying to read our code. We don't have to hold as many variables in their head, because we can see the steps broken down and read the intermediate values without having to use a debugger.\n",
