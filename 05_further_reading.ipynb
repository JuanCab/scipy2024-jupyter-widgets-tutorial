    "+ A SciPy 2002 tutorial focused on the [core Jupyter widgets and related packages](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/tutorial)\n",
    "    + The folder notebooks/03.Widget_events has a step by step example of using a pure widget/traitlets approach that is a little different than what is outlined in this tutorial.\n",
    "+ The [`ipywidgets` documentation](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n",
    "+ There a lot of widget packages available. A good list is [here](https://github.com/nicole-brewer/awesome-jupyter-widgets)."

    "+ [anywidget](https://anywidget.dev/) gives you lots of flexibility to make custom widgets using some javascript without the usual overhead of making a javascript-based widget. They also presented a [tutorial in the morning session](https://github.com/manzt/scipy-2024-anywidget), it is worth checking out!\n",
    "+ [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) allows you to construct interactive dashboards in Python. Another tutorial this morning was [hvPlot and Panel: Easy data visualization, data exploration, and data apps](https://holoviz.org/tutorial/). It is also worth a look!"
