    "### Step 2: Install Required Libraries\n",
    "We provide a `conda` environment file that you can use to create an environment with all the required libraries. To create the environment, navigate to the directory where you cloned the tutorial repository and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can activate this environment by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate complexapps-2024\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch `jupyter lab` while in this environment.\n",
