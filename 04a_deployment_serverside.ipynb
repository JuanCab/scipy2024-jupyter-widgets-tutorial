Because service providers will have different processess for setting up such a server, we will just outline the broad strokes.\n",

    "#### Use a Dockerfile or set up Voilà manually\n",

    "Some composible services support starting images directly from Dockerfiles, while others may require you to log into the node to install Docker, use [`scp`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scp-command-in-linux-with-examples/) to transer your Dockerfile, and build your container for yourself.

    "Set up security groups or firewall rules to allow inbound traffic on the port you will be using (e.g., port 8866 for Voilà). Ensure that SSH access (port 22) is also allowed so you can manage your server. SSH access also requires setting up a key pair. Generate SSL certificates manually or use a service like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to enable HTTPS.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Serving a Single Document or an Entire Directory**: You can serve a single notebook or an entire directory of notebooks with Voilà.\n",
    "  - Serving a single notebook is easier as you can set up a single Voilà process to serve the notebook.\n",
    "  - If you serve a directory:\n",
    "    - Voilà will create a landing page with links to each notebook. You can also create an index notebook that serves as a landing page for your dashboard.  We have successfully used a redirect from an apache/nginx web server landing page to the Voilà index notebook.\n",
    "    - For your visitors to be able to access multiple notebooks, you MUST serve the entire directory with Voilà.  - Each notebook visited will be a separate Voilà instance, so you will need to consider the memory and CPU requirements of your server.\n",
    "- **Memory**: Voilà processes can sometimes have memory leaks and can sometimes crash.  Its probably a good idea to have inactive sessions self terminate. Furthermore, one of us has used a cronjob to restart Voilà every minute after checking if it is still running.  The Voilà instructions do provide some guidance on how to set up a systemd service to run Voilà and keep it running.\n",
    "- **Load**: If you have multiple simultaneous users, you will want to make sure you have a robust server to handle the load.\n",
    "- **Security**: Voilà had some security issues that were fixed in version 0.5.6. Make sure you are running a version that is at least that new. As with any publicly-facing server, you will want to make sure you are keeping up with security patches.  The Voilà documentation seemingly assumes you are running Voilà as a standalone server, and runs it as root.  You *can* run Voilà as a non-root user, but you will need to be familiar with Linux permissions."
